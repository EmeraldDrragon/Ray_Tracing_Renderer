# Ray_Tracing_Renderer
CPU Ray Tracer

personal project

The renderer works on CPU, 
accelerated with standard c++ cpu multithreading

The renderer works on polygon meshes, 
uses blinn-phong shading,
has a positionable camera

I intent to implement realistic physics based shading
and faster ray triangle intersection
plus a better .obj file input and mesh storing
