# Ray_Tracing_Renderer
CPU Ray Tracer

personal project, C++

## Introduction
This project is a CPU-based Ray Tracer. It loads triangle meshes
from .obj files and renders images of 3D scenes.

The renderer works on polygon meshes, 
uses blinn-phong shading,
has a positionable camera

I intent to implement realistic physics based shading
and faster ray triangle intersection
plus a better .obj file input and mesh storing
